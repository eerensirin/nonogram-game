    `Do you remember the first time we sat across from each other, two cups of coffee between us, the steam curling up like small questions neither of us dared to ask? I remember. I remember the way you held your cup with both hands, as if it held something more precious than coffee.`,

    `Since that morning, every ordinary thing has become a little extraordinary. A walk through the park became an expedition. A rainy afternoon became a reason to stay close. A stray cat on the sidewalk became our shared secret — we named it, didn't we? We gave it a story, the way we give everything a story.`,

    `I made this puzzle game for you. Each level is a small memory, a tiny picture drawn in squares. A coffee cup for our mornings. A heart for the obvious reason. An envelope for every note I wanted to write but typed into my phone instead. A star for the nights we stayed up too late, talking about nothing and everything.`,

    `You solved them all. Forty little puzzles, forty little pieces of us. Some were easy, some were tricky — not unlike the real thing. But you stayed. You figured them out. You didn't give up.`,

    `I don't have grand words. I'm not a poet. But I know this: the world is quieter when you're not around, and louder — in the best way — when you are. You make the ordinary feel like a gift.`,

    `So here is mine. A small, imperfect, pixelated gift. Every square I filled in, I was thinking of you. Every story snippet, I wrote with your laugh in my head. Every chapter was a chapter of us.`,

    `Thank you for playing. Thank you for staying. Thank you for being the reason I wanted to make something — anything — just to see you smile.`,
